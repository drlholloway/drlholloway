- 👋 Hi, I’m @drlholloway
- 👀 I’m interested in games, artificial intelligence, formal verification, data structures, modeling, and procedurally generated content.
- 🌱 I’m currently going through Generative Deep Learning 2nd Ed. book.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on I'm not sure yet
- I make static GitHub Pages sites in order to play with front-end technologies like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for fun (plus we're all supposed to have webpages about ourselves at this point, right?)
- I think the Linux CLI is pretty good but can be made great with [Oh My Bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash).
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://wwww.twitter.com/drlholloway), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lane-holloway-phd), ???

I've had many GitHub accounts but they've almost always been associated with my work. Now, I've made this one that will be for personal projects or my work or topics that I want to explore on my own.
